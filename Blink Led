💡 Blink LED Project Using Arduino

I recently started my arduino learning with a beginner-friendly project: blinking an LED using an Arduino Uno.
This simple experiment helped me understand how microcontrollers control digital outputs.

What I learned:
🔸 Basic Arduino coding
🔸 Configuring GPIO pins
🔸 Using pinMode() and digitalWrite()
🔸 Timing with delay()

Excited to try more Arduino projects ahead!
