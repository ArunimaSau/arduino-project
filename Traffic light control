🚦Moving on with my journey of embedded systems, next I tried to build a simple project of traffic light control with the timer counter. Before building this I had to learn about the 
 seven segment display for timer logic.
📌 Key Learnings
 1.Basics of embedded systems.
 2.Seven segment display and its segment connections.
 3.Including the library Sevseg for displaying digits on the seven segment display.
 4.Use of delay() function and some conditional statements. 
 5..Translating real-world systems into code
